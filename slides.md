ABSTRACT 
 
Over the past year, a team newly based in the Centre for Academic Development has taken responsibility for consolidating and reconfiguring high performance computing resources at Victoria University of Wellington. Accompanying this technical reboot have been refreshed approaches to support, training, community building, rebranding and data gathering.  
This paper will outline the proceses and practices adopted in this holistic approach to research support and researcher development, ranging from wrangling computing nodes into a shipping container, to onboarding non-typical users to an HPC environment. It will overview tools utilised (Slurm, Slack, GitHub, MKDocs, Ganglia, AWS Cost Calculator), training and events offered (Carpentries workshops, ResBaz, community catch-ups), and approaches undertaken (including developing a capability tied to available resources, reporting metrics, alignment with NeSI environments, and engagement with internal and external stakeholders).
